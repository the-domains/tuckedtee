# Tuck takes on the 'big' city

**Casually refined **is who I am to my core. I am a rule follower, but I believe rules are meant to be flexible. I take myself seriously enough to be respected professionally, but who wants to work with someone who can't make fun of themselves and let loose from time to time? That's what I believe Tucked Tee is always about. Button it up when it's necessary, but let loose enough so you don't go crazy.

At Tucked Tee you will find a combination of 'life's answers,' my style, KC recommendations, drink and food recipes, running escapade stories and any other nonsense I decide to post on here.

I was born and raised in the 'middle-of-nowhere' Kansas, I found myself longing to live in a city. I traveled with my family enough to know what it was like. I always felt **alive** when visiting any city larger than where I grew up. I felt like I could be myself. I could let my freak flag fly, and no one would care enough to stop me.

Flash forward to today -- I'm living in KC and absolutely loving it. KC is a casually refined city, in my opinion. We don't take ourselves too seriously, but serious enough when needed. I truly believe this is the best city to live in within the United States. You get a big city feel, while manners are still in check (important to anyone who grew up in Kansas).

I'm engaged to the love of my life and we have a fur baby (Luna). My fianc√© and I plan on staying in KC for a long time, even long enough to raise a family. We're both close enough to our families for visiting, but far enough away to mitigate unexpected visits. ;)

I work in the advertising industry. I primarily work on custom intelligent software solutions for large companies to implement local marketing. I'm very passionate about what I do, but, this site is meant for what I'm passionate about outside of work. I hope you enjoy it!
